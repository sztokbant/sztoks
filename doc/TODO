- IntelliJ read environment variables from .env

The following are old TODOs which may or may not still make sense (2022-03-03)

BUG:

[] (minor) Home net worth = 0 when assetsTotal = NULL
[] Apparent DB concurrency issue, got error after setting several isResettable in a row

Investigate potential bug:

[] Lock/refresh of Tithing & FutureTithing accounts on update

Idea:

[] Button "move to income" from "Receivable"

Improvement:

[/] Add only relevant info to response and potentially reduce amount of SQL statements

[] Use account findByIdAndSnapshotId() and we won't need to test "account does not belong in snapshot" or "account does not belong to user" unit-tests

[] ForEx / Stocks API: https://rapidapi.com/alphavantage/api/alpha-vantage?endpoint=apiendpoint_bd8edfba-9210-4c3e-bee4-5ca78e1fe962

QA

[/] LOGS
[] UNIT-TESTS
  [] Account remove controller is not allowed to remove tithing/futuretithing accounts

Model

[] Category enums should be type enumerate so they store strings, not ints, in DB
  [] They should have abbreviations too
[] LOCK OLD SNAPSHOTS (with a checkbox?)
[] Past snapshots should confirm on every update

UX improvements

[] next/prev snapshot buttons should be on the permanent top bar
[] javascript to hide "profit only future tithing" for SimpleAssets, Receivables
[] Sort baseCurrency first
[] ignore case when sorting

Performance

[] Delete snapshot should delete ALL data at once instead of one txn/account at a time
